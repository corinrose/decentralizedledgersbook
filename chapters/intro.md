You hear that blockchain technology is going to impact more or less every area where computing is used, but what about it really gives it such broad applications?

By their very structure, blockchain's give you a power naming scheme for addressing data by content, rather than by location, using hashing. This also builds in data integrity checks for free.

State machines are a prototypical model of computation. 

A data structure is a way of organizing data, often with a specific interface in mind.
