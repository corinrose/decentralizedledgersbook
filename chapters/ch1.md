# Historical Context

The origin of blockchain technology is usally traced to the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper, which was published in 2008 in response to the financial crisis. This was no duobt a seminal moment, but the real context for this 2008 release goes back quite a bit farther. 

## Money

This book cannot be a complete exposition of this history. In his work [*Shelling Out: The Origins of Money*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/), Nick Szabo--a name you will become familiar with--discusses the origins of money back 75,000 years before present. He traces the development of money as a technology that represents value, and the concurrent development of language. As this technology evolved, an ecosystem for interacting with this technology did too.

## Single to Multi Ledger Accounting

Along with this money evolved a way to keep track of trades of wealth--ledgers. Early ledgers were single-entry, where every transaction is noted once in the ledger. Over time, double-entry accounting evolved as a more effective way to keep track of transactions. A double-entry accounting system has two entries for every transaction--one keeping track of the credit involved with the transaction, and one for the debt. For instance, if you are a merchant and you sell a product, you would add the value of that transaction to your revenue in the double-entry system and at the same time remove that value from your stock. Double-entry ledgers have been found as early as the 11th century, the idea was standardized by mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494 in his work [*Summa de arithmetica*].

Cryptography is not a new technology--the infamous Caesar cipher, while simple, has been used for millenia, although there are earlier examples. However, up until the 1970s, this crytography
